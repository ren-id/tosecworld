            <h3>Commercial Market</h3>
            <p class="clear-border">The Commercial Market is essential for every business, but not all business
                owners nor boards of directors within a company can see it. The commercial market is one of our
                capabilities to help business owners and boards of directors recognize a market according to the
                companys products.</p>
            <p>Based on market research methods that we carry out, we are able to provide findings to help
                companies comprehend the market better, so companies acquire more commercial markets. Using
                research, companies will have a better grasp on: market conditions and changes. With an
                understanding of market conditions and changes, companies can pick out more appropriate and feasible
                strategies for short-, medium- and long-terms following the nature of their product market.</p>

            <h3>Design and System</h3>
            <p>Design & system are parts of our capabilities to help companies have more meaningful and more commercial
                value, by
                optimizing all the company's resources effectively.</p>
            <p>The design & system that we do is primarily focused on achieving more commercial long-term targets, so
                the company can
                grow and develop. By processing primary and secondary data to analyze potential risks that may occur
                both internally and
                externally which can hinder the realization of the predetermined targets.</p>

            <h3>Organization and Human</h3>
            <p class="clear-border">The dynamics that occur in business for all industries have demanded each company to
                never stop growing and innovating.
                It also requires changes in the organization and changes in the people within the organization.</p>
            <p>In achieving these demands for change, we help demonstrate the superior potential of human resources
                within the company,
                mapping and recommending placements, as well as building both a work culture and an information culture
                following the
                needs and direction of the targets set by the company.</p>
